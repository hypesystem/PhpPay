*Totally cool payments abstraction*

Every time you need to integrate a payments solution, you have to get used to a new library.
That's super annoying.
What if there was a single interface that could be configured to use any of the most popular payments solutions?
This is an attempt at that.
Cool.

To get to know the library, see the [examples](EXAMPLES.md).

Disclaimer
==========

This library is not just pre-1.0.
It is pre-0.1.
Be very cautions (read the code) before using it in production.
