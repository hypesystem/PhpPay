Examples
========

There are a couple of examples included in this library, to help you see how to use the code.
You should inspect the code behind the examples to see how they work.
To see the examples in action, you need to run a web server with PHP.
For example, I run a server that places this library at `http://prog/PhpPay`.
To run the PayPal example, I do the following:

1. Go to `/examples/paypal/` (in my case, `http://prog/PhpPay/examples/paypal/`).
2. Enter the information.
   The URL must be the full URL of your current server (in my case, `http://prog/PhpPay/examples/paypal/`).
   You need a PayPal API login.
